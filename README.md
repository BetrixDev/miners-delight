# Miner's Delight

An old attempt at re-creating [Miner's Haven](https://www.roblox.com/games/258258996/Miners-Haven-Sandbox-Tycoon) for the web using three.js and next.js.

I worked on this in October of 2023 and have achieved the basic building, inventory and shop mechanics.

The current state is not playable.

Uploading this to GitHub just to track the things I've done.

### Demo of what is there
